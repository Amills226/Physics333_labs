# FM Radio final project

## Project Idea

My original Idea was to create a fm radio from an arduino with and LED display using a Sparkfun Breakout tuner. 

## Problems

I was unable to make the display part to be operational. 

I also ran into a problem with the breakout board, I have fried it, and because I was unable to recieve a new board in time this was a catistrafic failure. 
I am however very condifent in the rest of the work, so if I were to recieve a new board it would be operational. 

I have come to the conclusion that I have fried it bacause I borrowed my friends pocket oscilloscope and I am unable to run a current through the board. 

## What I have learned

I have learned more about:

* I2C communications

* capaciters and their relation to sound

* schematic reading

* how my homemade amplifier and the breakout tuner board are supposed to operate

## Conclusion

While I would have loved to have had an operating radio at the end of this project I learned a lot about digital circuits and I had a lot of fun. 

## Future Improvements  

* Create operating display case

* Move operation to a more contained case that is portable

* have a battery option as well as a plug in
